Spring in Action 5 - Example Code 

Chapter 1

Default is JAR, can change to WAR if not run in Spring.

SpringBootApplication is SpringBootConfiguration, EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan

On its own, @Controller
doesnâ€™t do much. Its primary purpose is to identify this class as a component for component
scanning.

SpringRunner is alias for current SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.

To test with main application tests, need
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureMockMvc;
@AutoConfigureMockMvc before class
(https://mkyong.com/spring-boot/spring-boot-test-unable-to-autowired-mockmvc/)

Did not need @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)

Edit Starters is in Spring menu when right-click pom.

Added h2 database in pom.

Add to main/resources/application.properties to enable h2-console
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console

Chapter 2

Could not initialize Ingredients.
List<Ingredient> ingredients = Arrays.asList( new Ingredient[] { ...

I cannot get lombok code to compile. I have confirmed that annotations are executed at
compile time. I have run the lombok installer. I have added lombok.jar to the VM options.
I give up.

Error in filterByType: <Ingredient> should be List<Ingredient>
private List<Ingredient> filterByType(List<Ingredient> ingredients, Type type) {
		return ingredients
				.stream()
				.filter(x -> x.getType().equals(type))
				.collect(Collectors.toList());
	}

Taco class does not exist yet. Must create it.
	
@Controller marks for component scan. Spring will discover, create bean in context.

@RequestMapping defines prefix of url that directs here

@GetMapping will define that the method will handle Get requests for the RequestMapping path.
